                <h2>Computer History</h2>
                   <p>Computers have been around for nearly 200 years. The word computer originally referred to humans who performed calculations, like in the movie Hidden Figures. Now it can refer to a machine whose primary purpose is calculating.</p>  </p>

                <h2>File Manipulation</h2>
                    <p>It is possible to create and manipulate files directly in VS code. There are multiple ways to do it. You can use the navigation system to create a file or the command prompt. You can specify the filetype/extension when you name the file.
                    </p>

                <h2>GitHub</h2>
                    <p>GitHub gives you the ability to collaborate on code with your team. It is considered a distributed version control system.
                    </p>
                
                <h2>Markdown Language</h2>
                    <p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. This week, we used markdown language to format a simple webpage. One of the benefits of Markdown language is that it is less involved than HTML.
                    </p>

                <h2>Repositories</h2>
                    <p>A repository is a storage space in GitHub where the files for storage and version history are kept. This week the whole class has been adding blogs to the SideQuests repository. We have also been creating our own repositories for various projects.</p>

                <h2>Version Control</h2>
                    <p>Version Control is a feature in GitHub that allows you to see a history of the changes made to the repository, very similar to the version history in google docs. This makes it easier to identify problems in the code.
                    </p>
                
                <h2>Github Pages</h2>
                    <p>Github pages allows you to host your repository on the internet. This makes it easy to retrieve the document at any time.</p>
